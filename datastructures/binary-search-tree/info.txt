Binary Search Tree :
	Data structure meant to process a stream of data in sorted order. Very useful
	if you dont know the size of the data set at compile time and need to process them in
	sorted order. 
	For non-balanced BST : O(n) insertion, O(n) deletion, O(n) query
	for balanced BST : O(logn) insertion,deletion, query
	Java contains out of the box balanced BST (TreeMap)
