Hibernate:
	- You must use cascade annotation if you want to cascade repo operation
	  (i.e insert update etc)
	- The mappedBy attrubute descrives the instance variable of the
	  entity that OWNS the foreign key (i.e has the foreign key as column)
	- Make sure to wire up you services and repository (Autowire)
