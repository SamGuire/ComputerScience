We will be sending about N amounts of requests at the same time.  N should be a big number to see the benefits of an in memory database. The case study mentioned 4.7k timeline requests per
second so use that as a input for the simulation.js script (node simulation.js 4700). Although more optimzation is found in the real twitter server, this should show the benefits of common
and expensive requests.
