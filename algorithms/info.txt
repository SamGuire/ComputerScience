Algorithms:
	- set of instructions to solve a problem.
	- algos are important regardless if we get better hardware because if the input size of the problem grows, eventually the hardware will not keep up.
	- space and time needs to be considered, however space is the cheaper aspect of machines, RAM is getting cheaper and cheaper so time is becoming more of a bottleneck.
	- RULE OF THUMB: Make the algorithm simple and easy to read first in the real world, alot of the time, your bottleneck isnt cpu instrcution but I/O related (db calls, network, etc)
	- O(1) < O(lgn) < O(n) < O(nlgn) <  O(n2) < O(n3) < O(2^n) < O(n!)
	- Pure algorithms (algo using nothing but pure data and arrays) will be implemented using python. Algorithms that require knowing more about data structures and data types will be
	  implemented with java. ex : sorting algos, dp algorithms, classic greedy algos -> python, 
				      tree algos, string parsing and manipulation, bit manipulation algos, graph traversal -> java
